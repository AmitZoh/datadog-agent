# Each section from every releasenote are combined when the

# must be readable independently of the other.

# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    Prevent a containerized agent from using the OS hostname as datadog agent hostname.
    Datadog agent hostname should be stable and should reflect the identity of the host they are monitoring.
    Container ID or kubernetes POD names are not suitable for that purpose.
    Thatâ€™s why the agent should avoid using the OS hostname when it is running in a dedicated UTS namespace.
    Note that the agent is relying on many other smart ways of discovering the real hostname of the host
    (EC2/AWS metadata server, docker daemon, kubernetes node names)
    This change only acts as a safety belt when all those smart ways of discovering the hostname are not usable.
